# angular-scroll-panels
First [Demo](https://kotilai.github.io/angular-scroll-panels/) (just opens and closes panels)
### Todo
* Opening and closing side panel changes main panel scroll position
* Uses Flex -> IE testing
* Header height is hard coded
* Currently assumes header height is static. Dynamic header size support?
* Possible page footer

## Goal
To create two scrollable panels horizontally, main and side, that can be independently scrolled and side panel can be closed. When side panel is closed, window becomes scrollable and navbar stays top.

This repo is going to be a testing ground for achieving above goals. Implementation will presumably change a lot.

## Requirements
* IE support
* Smooth operation, no bouncing when side panel opens/closes
